# Text-Processors
Text-processing programs to extract a word list from a given dictionary and perform multiple operations in the resulting file, which can be used as the basis for the development of several word games, such as scrabble, hidden words, crosswords, or others.

The development of the programs is made in a modular way, so that some of the functions can be reused in other programs to be developed in the future.

The first program's function is to "isolate" the entries (headwords) in a dictionary, in order to produce a list of valid words. The dictionary is stored in a text file. The list of resulting words is also stored in a text file.

The second program's purpose is to implement and test some functions, that can be used in the future development of word games, for doing common operations like: verify if a given word exists in a word list; verify if a given word can be made using a given set of letters or show all the words that can be made using a given set of letters.
