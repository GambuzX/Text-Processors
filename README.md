Programs developed as middle semester projects for the curricular unit PROG.

**Final Grade: 20**

### Description
Programs to **extract a word list from a given dictionary and perform multiple operations in the resulting file**, which can be used as the basis for the development of several word games, such as scrabble, hidden words, crosswords, or others.

The development of the programs is made in a modular way, so that some of the functions can be reused in other programs to be developed in the future.

:one: The first program's function is to "isolate" the entries (headwords) in a dictionary, in order to produce a list of valid words. The dictionary is stored in a text file. The list of resulting words is also stored in a text file.

:two: The second program's purpose is to implement and test some functions, that can be used in the future development of word games, for doing common operations like: verify if a given word exists in a word list; verify if a given word can be made using a given set of letters or show all the words that can be made using a given set of letters.
